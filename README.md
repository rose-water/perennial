## Perennial
Perennial is a meditation born from daydreams, pieced together from fragments of self-reflection and self-care and inspired by nature and the cosmos. This is a personal project that was created as an attempt to suspend time. Perhaps it is taking you somewhere, or maybe it is the destination.

Perennial is a little world, a gentle vessel, a patient portal.

This project was exhibited as an interactive installation at the Gray Area Showcase on June 27-28, 2018.

Built with Cinema 4D, Three.js, and Leap Motion.
